Cancer Prediction
Attribute Information:

Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign) 3-32)
Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:

radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
perimeter
area
smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
symmetry
fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)
